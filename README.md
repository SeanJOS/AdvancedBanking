# Advance Banking for Exile
###### Made by Shix and WolfkillArcadia
Advance Banking is a complete rewrite of Exile's default money system. It separates Exile Money into a wallet and a personal bank making money a more valuable object. This, in turn, creates a more realistic survival scenario.

#### Server Owners:
Advanced Banking is coded to make the transition from default Exile money system to Advanced Banking. No database wipes are required, as that it moves the players current Exile Money to their personal bank accounts. Even works with "10,000 starter money"!

#### Changing ATMs
Currently the ATMs are placed for Altis, and are controlled via AdvBanking_Server\code\ExileServer_banking_map_placeATM.sqf. This output is from M3Editor and can easily be adapted to any map. If you would like to share your ATM placement, please pass the files to us and we will update the github.
